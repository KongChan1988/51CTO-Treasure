每一个寂静夜晚的梦里
Every night in my dreams
我都能看见你，触摸你
I see you, I feel you,
因此而确信你仍然在守候
That is how I know you go on
穿越那久远的时空距离
Far across the distance
你轻轻地回到我的身边
And spaces between us
告诉我，你仍然痴心如昨
You have come to show you go on
无论远近亦或身处何方
Near, far, wherever you are
我从未怀疑过心的执著
I believe that the heart does go on
当你再一次推开那扇门
Once more you open the door
清晰地伫立在我的心中
And you're here in my heart
我心永恒，我心永恒
And my heart will go on and on
爱曾经在刹那间被点燃
Love can touch us one time
并且延续了一生的传说
And last for a lifetime
直到我们紧紧地融为一体
And never let go till we're one
爱曾经是我心中的浪花
Love was when I loved you
我握住了它涌起的瞬间
One true time I hold to
我的生命，从此不再孤单
In my life we'll always go on
无论远近亦或身处何方
Near, far, wherever you are
我从未怀疑过心的执著
I believe that the heart does go on
当你再一次推开那扇门
Once more you open the door
清晰地伫立在我的心中
And you're here in my heart
我心永恒，我心永恒
And my heart will go on and on
真正的爱情永远不会褪色
There is some love that will not go away
你在身边让我无所畏惧
You're here, there's nothing I fear,
我深知我的心不会退缩
And I know that my heart will go on
我们将永远地相依相守
We'll stay forever this way
这里会是你安全的港湾
You are safe in my heart
我心永恒，我心永恒
And my heart will go on and on
